    " - Like class 3 when we worked with GitHub, there is a **base url**.  In this case it's `https://twitter.com/search`\n",

    " - What about hash symbols?  If you search for `#MeToo`, `#GirlsWhoCode` or `#DataScience`, what happens with that `#` symbol?\n",
    " - Once you get the hang of this, see if you can just re-create some searches yourself by creating the url directly, and bypassing the search box altogether.  Ie, be familiar enough with how searches are formatted that you know `https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataScience` will take you to the same page as typing in `#DataScience` into the search box.\n",

Keep this in mind if you have a function that's working, but 45 minutes later it doesn't and you haven't changed anything.  This usually means the data you're getting back from your API calls isn't what it's supposed to be because you've exhausted your limits. We won't hold you to double checking for all of this in your functions.\n",

    "Basically you have to do a `while` loop to continually make a new request using the values stored in the `next_cursor` key as part of your next query string until there's nothing left to search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We're using the free API, so we're operating under some limitations.  One of them being that you can only make 15 API calls in a 15 minute span to this portion of the API.  You can also only return up to 200 results per cursor, so this means you won't be able to completely search for everyone even if you set this up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's fine, just do what you can under the circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To Test:** To test your function, we'll run the following function calls:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `friends_of_friends(['ezraklein', 'tylercowen'])` -- should return 4 results if you do an API call that returns 200 results\n",
    " - `friends_of_friends(['ezraklein', 'tylercowen'], full_search=True)` -- should return 54 results if you do an API call that returns 200 results\n",
    " \n",
    "**Hint:** Chances are you will exhaust your API limits quite easily in this function depending on who you search for.  Depending on how you have things set up, this could cause error messages to arise when things are otherwise fine.  Remember in class 3 when we were getting those weird dictionaries back because our limits were used up?  We won't hold you accountable for handling this inside your function, although it could make some things easier for your own testing.\n",
