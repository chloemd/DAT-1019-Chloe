    "#### Sections\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Section 1:** Setting up your developer account, using OAuth1 authentication (approx 45-120 minutes)\n",
    " - **Sections 2 & 3:** Navigating the API documentation, getting your first query strings (approx 45-120 minutes)\n",
    " - **Section 3:** Writing your API calls (approx 90 - 360 minutes)\n",
    " \n",
    "#### What You'll Turn In:  \n",
    " - A `.py` (not a Notebook!) file that contains the functions that you were prompted to create.  These should contain comments demonstrating why your code does what it does, and after it's run, the instructor should be able to make the appropriate function calls in Spyder or any other IDE."

    " - Go to the **Apps** section of your developer portal\n",
    " - Click on the **Details** button for the app that you just created\n",
    " - Click on the **Keys & Tokens** tab:\n",
    "   - Two keys should already be given to you:  **API Key** & **API Secret Key**\n",

    " - Generate your Access Token and Access Token Secret keys.  You'll need to write these down when you're done -- you can only see them once.\n",
    "\n",

The only thing you'll need to change is the info for your API tokens that are passed into the `OAuth1()` function.\n",

    "If you'd like, you can drop the `&src=typed_query` from the url and still get the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some important details to pay attention to:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Like class 3 when we worked with GitHub, there is a **base url**.  In this case it's `https://twitter.com/search`\n",
    " - Whenever you enter a search for something, the base url will be followed by something that looks like `?q=My%20Search%20Term`\n",
    "  - The `?` marks the beginning of the query string.  This basically says 'initiate a request with whatever parameters that follow'\n",
    "  - The `q` is a **parameter**, essentially some condition to pass into the query string that determines what results will be given back to you.  In this case, `q` encodes the text you typed in into something the API can understand.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Useful Thing To Do Right Now:** Go back to the Twitter search page, and just try searching for different things, and notice what shows up after the `q=`.  Here are some questions to ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    " - How are white spaces encoded?  Ie, if you search for `Jonathan Bechtel` in the search box, what shows up to account for the space between the two words?\n",
    " - What about hash symbols?  If you search for `#MeToo`, `#GirlsWhoCode` or `#DataScience`, what happens with that `#` symbol?\n",
    " - Once you get the hang of this, see if you can just re-create some searches yourself by creating the url directly, and bypassing the search box altogether.  Ie, be familiar enough with how searches are formatted that you know `https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataScience` will take you to the same page as typing in `#DataScience` into the search box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's try and make a request for a search for `Data Science`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at Twitter's docs, you'll see that the base url for the search API is `'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you have to add the `?q=Whatever%20Word%20%Goes%20Here` to the end to complete the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "So go ahead, and see if you can create your API call for a search for the term `Data Science`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did it correctly, you should have a dictionary with a key called `statuses`, and it'll be a list with all of the tweets returned by your search.  "

    "Query strings basically have two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The `?` initiates the beginning of the API call, and basically says 'everything that follows this will encode something about the information that's going to get returned to you'.\n",
    " - What follows that is are a bunch of symbols followed by `=` signs.  These are parameters.\n",
    " - So when you make an api call to `'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?q=My%20Search%20Term`, the `q` is a paremeter.  \n",
    " - You can add multiple paremeters to a query string. They are separated by `&`. They dictate what kinds of results are returned.  \n",
    "  - For example, a parameter you can use in Twitter's search API is `count`, which tells you how many results to return.  The default is 15, but you can return up to 100.  So if we wanted to search for tweets and return 50 results our query string would look like the following:\n",
    "    `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?q=My%20Search%20String&count=50`\n",
    "  - You can add as many of these parameters to your string as you'd like.  So for example, if we wanted to include parameters for `count` and `result_type`, we could do the following: `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?q=My%20Search%20String&count=50&result_type=mixed`\n",
    "  \n",
    "To get the hang of this, try searching for tweets that mention the hashtag `#DeepLearning`, and return 75 results."

    "**What you'll turn in:** A `.py` file with all of the functions written.  We should be able to load this into an IDE, run the file, and then call your functions to verify how and if they work. This file should also be properly commented so we can follow your line of reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions you'll be prompted to write will be defined in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **name:** the name of the function\n",
    " - **returns:** what the function should return\n",
    " - **arguments:** arguments to include inside the function in order to specify how it should behave.\n",
    " \n",
    " **Note:** The free API has limitations built into it, so this means from time-to-time you'll only be able to return some of the results from the API.  This is fine.  It's understood and recognized that your functions won't be able to return an entire list of someone's users or other such things, so as long as your work delivers the best it can under present circumstances you'll be in good shape.\n",

    " - It's okay if you get stuck somewhere.  If there's one item that you can't figure out and it doesn't quite work right, it's probably best to move on and try other things.  Again, try and explain what you were looking to do.  You'll pass if you give an honest effort.\n",
    " - There's potentially a lot of error handling you could do to verify user input is correct, but you can leave that alone for now.  Just make sure the core purpose of the function works the way it's supposed to.\n",
    " - While you're working on this, it's possible you may bump into your API limits.  Keep this in mind if you have a function that's working, but 45 minutes later it doesn't and you haven't changed anything.  This usually means the data you're getting back from your API calls isn't what it's supposed to be because you've exhausted your limits. We won't hold you to double checking for all of this in your functions.\n",
    " - In the file you turn in, make sure your requests are referencing your API tokens, so that way we can run your file right away.  Ie, make sure somewhere in your script you have a variable at the top that reads `tokens = OAuth1('token1', 'token2', 'token3', 'token4')` so it can be used for your requests inside the file."

    "\n",
    "The twitter API only returns a subset of users in your results to save bandwidth, so you have to cycle through multiple result sets to get all of the values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Basically you have to do a `while` loop to continually make a new request using the values stored in the `next_cursor` key as part of your next query string until there's nothing left to search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We're using the free API, so we're operating under some limitations.  One of them being that you can only make 15 API calls in a 15 minute span to this portion of the API.  You can also only return up to 200 results per cursor, so this means you won't be able to completely search for everyone even if you set this up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's fine, just do what you can under the circumstances.\n",

    " - `friends_of_friends(['ezraklein', 'tylercowen'])` -- should return 4 results if you do an API call that returns 200 results\n",
    " - `friends_of_friends(['ezraklein', 'tylercowen'], full_search=True)` -- should return 54 results if you do an API call that returns 200 results\n",
    " \n",
    "**Hint:** Chances are you will exhaust your API limits quite easily in this function depending on who you search for.  Depending on how you have things set up, this could cause error messages to arise when things are otherwise fine.  Remember in class 3 when we were getting those weird dictionaries back because our limits were used up?  We won't hold you accountable for handling this inside your function, although it could make some things easier for your own testing.\n",
