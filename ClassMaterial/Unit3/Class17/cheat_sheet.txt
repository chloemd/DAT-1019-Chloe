Class 17 Cheat Sheet

**CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT**

TO CREATE: 

conda create --name myenv

(myenv is the name of your virtual environment, and you can use whatever name you'd like)

TO INITIALIZE:

conda activate myenv

TO SHUT DOWN:

conda deactivate

TO INSTALL PACKAGES FROM A REQUIREMENTS.TXT

pip install -r requirements.txt

FOR RUNNING HEROKU

STEP 1:
HEROKU CREATE 

 -- this initializes an instance of your app

STEP 2:

heroku git:remote -a name-of-your-heroku-app-485858

 -- this creates a remote repository that heroku reads from to deploy your app

STEP 3:

git push heroku master

 -- this is like an ordinary git push, except to your heroku remote.  this is how you deploy changes to your code

HEROKU CAVEATS:

 - You must have a requirements.txt file with all of your dependencies in your repo
 - You must have a PROCFILE in your repo.  This file essentially tells Heroku how to start your app.
 - PROCFILE requirements change from app to app depending on what kind of build you have.  If you are using streamlit you need to have a setup.sh
file with the appropriate text that was given in class
 - Malformed procfiles are common reasons deployments do not go as planned so please pay close attention to this step
